TODO list

* Add a header photo of each product at the beginning of each guide if possible/if it makes sense
* create a "example macropad uses" template
* create a section before "see something that should change"
* create a user guide for FinnGus for the user guides section
* add a note that VIA and VIAL firmwares are typically not cross compatible and may result in mixed results
* fix headers/side bar for MAcropad1x5 and GB2 build guides
