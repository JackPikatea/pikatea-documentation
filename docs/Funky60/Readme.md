## Programming and Usage

#### VIAL
If you've followed the assembly guide correctly, the correct Vial firmware should be loaded onto your Funky60. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.6).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**
