## General Overview

The Funky60 is a keyboard designed to have a funky layout with the spacebar on top. This spacebar is typically mapped to backspace so that you can still type normally. The funky60 also has other layouts supported including a normal 60% layout, an Alice 40 and Ortholinear layout. 

More Details (Subject to change slightly)
* 5 Colors (E-White, Black, Grey, Dark Blue, Red and 1 other color to be determined by the IC)
* Uncoated Brass Weight
* 4 layouts supported
* hotswap option for normal and funky layouts (other layouts will likely have hotswap option judging from the early results of the IC)
* Mainboard and matrix board to make swapping layouts very easy
* Vial firmware
* Pro Micro footprint. Compatible with RP2040 and Elite C MCU equivilants
* Carrying case. The case you recevied is not the one we will use. [View picture at the bottom on this webpage.](/Funky60/Funky60-reviewer-guide.html#planned-changes)
