## General Overview

The Funky60 is a keyboard designed to have a funky layout with the spacebar on top. This spacebar is typically mapped to backspace so that you can still type normally. The funky60 also has other layouts supported including a normal 60% layout, an Alice 40 and Ortholinear layout. 

More Details (Subject to change slightly)
* 6 Colors (E-White, Black, Grey, Dark Blue, Red and 1 other color to be determined by the IC)
* Uncoated Brass Weight
* 4 layouts supported
* hotswap option for normal and funky layouts (other layouts will likely have hotswap option judging from the early results of the IC)
* Mainboard and matrix board to make swapping layouts very easy
* Vial firmware
* Pro Micro footprint. Compatible with RP2040 and Elite C MCU equivilants
* Carrying case. The case you recevied is not the one we will use. [View picture at the bottom on this webpage.](/Funky60/Funky60-reviewer-guide.html#planned-changes)

## Planned Changes

The keyboard you have is very close to the final board. Minor changes will be made. The weight will increase in thickness. The depth of the "Funky60" text in the weight will decrease. The small gap between the case and the weight on the sides of the board will be fixed. 

Here is a picture of the carring case we will use for the GB
