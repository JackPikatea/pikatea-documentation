## Programming and Usage

#### VIAL
Vial firmware is already loaded onto your KP69. Vial is an open source program and firmware that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.6).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**

## Important Info
<p style="background-color: yellow;"><strong>The case is printed in PLA. It can deform if left on an uneven surface in a hot environment for too long. Do not leave your KP69 in a HOT car for too long. Any temperature that is uncomfortable for yourself for an extended period of time would be too hot for too long. Just pretend it's a person/cat</strong></p>
