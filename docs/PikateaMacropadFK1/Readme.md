## Mounting
Mounting can be done with the included screws or the doubled sided tape. Place 1 of the 2 included mounting strips on the macropad and remove the protective covering. Align the Macropad to the underside of your desk, monitor or other surface and press firmly for 10 seconds or more if needed. The bond will grow stronger over time. Be careful not to cover up any monitor buttons.

More mounting tape can be bought on our store in sets of 4 and shipped in an envelope.

***Note: It's good practice to secure the USB cable with a cable tie or similar so that if the cord gets pulled the macropad is not effected.***

## Programming and Usage
If you've followed the assembly guide correctly, Vial firmware should be loaded onto your macropad. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.4.2).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**

<Uses/>

## QMK and VIA Programming
The Pikatea Macropad is compatible with QMK and VIA firmware.

[Pikatea QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/qmk_firmware) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by QMK and/or VIA

[Pikatea VIAL-QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/vial-qmk) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by Vial

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure you have the correct version of Vial installed for the firmware (in this case it's 0.4.2 beta). If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
