# Cerberus Assembly Guide

This guide uses a few photos from other keyboards but the assembly process remains the same. Ask on discord if you have any questions.

To complete this keyboard, you'll need [choc switches]() and [choc stabilizers]()

## Flash the MCU

It's important to flash the MCU before starting to make sure it works.

1. Download the .uf2 file for the device from the [firmware list](/DownloadsAndFiles/firmware-download-list.html). 
2. While holding the boot button, plug the MCU into the computer. 
3. Drag the .uf2 file into the new drive that shows up. Confirm the device shows up in [VIAL](http://get.vial.today) after it disconnects and reconnects.

## Solder the Diodes

1. Bend a diode and insert it into the PCB being careful it is the correct orientation. The black bar on the diode matches with the thicker white bar on the PCB.

2. After the diode is inserted, bend the leads outwards so it stays in place. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each diode.

3. With each diode in place, Solder them to be permanently secured.

4. Bend the diodes legs straight and use flush cuts to them off. Be careful not to scratch the PCB when doing this.

## Important Note


<div style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">It is VERY VERY important that you follow the correct order of operations. It is extremely difficult/impossible to assemble your keyboard if you solder the components in the wrong order.</div>

## Trim The Headers

The headers need to be trimmed or the case will not fit. The image shows different sized headers than the kit but the process is the same.

1. Cut the longer side of the headers in half as shown. It doesn't have to be precise.

## Solder The Headers

The following images shown are for a different keyboard but the steps still apply.

The first step is to solder the headers to the PCB. ONLY the headers. <div style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">DO NOT SOLDER THE MCU.</div> Place the headers into the PCB as shown and then add the MCU to stabilize them. Wrap a rubber band around the assembly to hold everything in place.

Solder only the headers to the PCB so that you end up with the following. DO NOT SOLDER THE MCU TO THE HEADERS YET

## Stabilizers and Switches

Solder each low-profile choc switch to the PCB. Be sure to include the stabilizers for the larger keys.

## Solder the MCU

Solder the MCU to the headers. This is the last of the critical order steps. Solder each pin.

## Finish Assembly

With the PCB and plate put together, it's time to assemble the remaining components and complete the keyboard. Cut strips of double sided tape and plate on the mounting tabs as shown. Peel back the tape to reveal the sticky section. Place the completed keyboard PCB assembly onto the case. It may take a few days for the adheasive tape to fully bond.

# Add keycaps and knobs

# That's it!

1. Celebrate. It's required.
