## Whatâ€™s in the Box
* (1) Pikatea Macropad GB4
* (1) USB Mini Cable
* (1) Allen Wrench
* (2) Screws
* (2) Mounting tape

## Mounting
Mounting can be done with the included screws or the doubled sided tape. Place 1 of the 2 included mounting strips on the macropad and remove the protective covering. Align the Macropad to the underside of your desk, monitor or other surface and press firmly for 10 seconds or more if needed. The bond will grow stronger over time. Be careful not to cover up any monitor buttons.

More mounting tape can be bought on our store in sets of 4.

***Note: It's good practice to secure the USB cable with a cable tie or similar so that if the cord gets pulled the macropad is not effected.***

## Programming and Usage
#### Vial
Vial compatible firmware is already loaded onto your macropad. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version.

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

*Note: 7 keys will be shown regardless if you have a 3-key, 5-key, or 7-key configuration. The extra keys will simply not work if they are not physically present.*

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the official Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**

## Example Uses
<Uses/>
 
## QMK and VIA Programming
The Pikatea Macropad is compatible with QMK and VIA firmware.

[Pikatea QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/qmk_firmware) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by QMK and/or VIA

[Pikatea VIAL-QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/vial-qmk) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by Vial

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure the USB cable is plugged in all the way. (Just because you see the LEDs going doesn't mean the data pins are connected)
* Make sure you have the latest version of Vial installed. (the web version has issues sometimes) If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
* reflash the firmware

Sometimes the device doesn't work as expected. If this is the case, we can do a replacement/repair up to 3 months after receiving your device.
