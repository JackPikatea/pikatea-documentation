# Sketchy Sketchy (with 3D printed case) Build Guide

This build guide largely follows the original build guide for the acrylic case written by DCPEDIT. Below are notible changes and differences that you should be aware while you follow that original guide.

## MCU orientation and programming
We decided to use an RP2040 based board for more memory. This is how it is orientated. It's recommended to program the MCU before soldering it to the circuit board. 
To program, plug in the "Elite Pi" MCU and copy this file into the drive that shows up. Download and install [Vial](http://get.vial.today) and verify the keyboard shows up before moving on.

## LCD screens

These screens are mounted a litte differently than instructed in the original documentation. Use the entire length of the header so that the LCD is as far away from the PCB as possible. 


## Case Construction
Obviously the case construction is completely different. Follow these pictures.

Base

Add foam

place plate and PCB assembly

Add top

Use the included M3x16mm screws for the 3 bottom holes and the included M3x30mm screws for the 4 top holes. Be careful not to strip the screws in the plastic.
