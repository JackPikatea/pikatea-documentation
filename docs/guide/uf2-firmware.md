# UF2 Firmware Guide

While holding the boot button on the MCU, plug it into a computer. There should be a new directory that shows up on the computer. Copy the .uf2 file to this directory. The MCU should automatically disconnect but unplug and re-plug in the MCU anyways. Open Vial and verify that you can see the device at the top before continuing. 

Contact us through support or Discord before continuing if you are encountering issues.
