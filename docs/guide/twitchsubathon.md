# Subathon Information
April 30th is my birthday and we are celebrating again with a Subathon/Birthday stream! I'll be streaming for at least 24 hrs and each sub, follower, bit and order adds time to the stream! We've got a rough planned schedule and lots of rewards/prizes. All the info is on this page.

If can edit this page [here](https://github.com/JackPikatea/pikatea-documentation/blob/main/docs/guide/twitchsubathon.md) if you spot something that needs changing or added.

### Time Amounts
Add time to the total amount I'll be streaming by doing the following

* T1 Subs adds 1.5 mins
* T2 Subs adds 5 mins
* T3 Subs adds 12 mins
* Gifted Subs add 3 mins
* 100 bits add 30 seconds
* Followers add 15 seconds
* every $10 USD on the Pikatea store adds 3 min
    The time from orders is automatically tracked but manually added periodically
*soft cap of 72 hours.

### New Changes for the Subathon
You might notice a few things are different for this stream!

* **Mat/Place** - Chat will have the opportunity to create a deskmat while we stream one pixel at a time. This activity is called "Mat/Place" and is inspired by Reddit's "r/place". We will have it available while I'm sleeping, 1 hour at each 12pm CST, while I'm eating or otherwise taking a break, and after each raid for 15 mins. I'll be ordering the desk mat after it's done! If we fill it up completely, we will start another one that is twice the size!
* **The Wheel** - Each subscriber will spin a virtual wheel on stream. On this wheel are different redeems. Most of them are just beeps but some are very special! (like the automatic confetti cannon). The Wheel is paused while I am away or sleeping.
* **TTS** - You can enable TTS if you cheer at least 25 bits with your chat message.

-   A full list of compatible characters can be found by using the command "!printable." Use special characters to make fun ASCII art.
-   Follow and/or subscribe, and your name gets printed out. We staple subscriber names in the shop!
