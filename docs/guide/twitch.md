# Twitch Stream Info and Commands
Everything you need to know to have a great time watching our twitch streams. We stream every Wednesday in the afternoon. [https://www.twitch.tv/JackPikatea](https://www.twitch.tv/JackPikatea)

### Receipt Printer

-   Print a simple message with "!print" followed by your message! Example: "!print this is a message."
-   Use \i to invert the color of the text at any point in the message. Example: "!print this is not inverted \i this is inverted."
-   A full list of compatible characters can be found by using the command "!printable." Use special characters to make fun ASCII art.
-   Follow and/or subscribe, and your name gets printed out. We staple subscriber names in the shop!
-   We have a few other hidden features you'll just have to figure out.

### Super Duper Prints

-   Print a very large message using the *Super Duper Print* channel reward. Non-subs only get 15 characters, but subs are not limited.
-   Raid the channel and your raid message will get printed out in *Super Duper* size.
-   Messages that include bits will get printed out in *Super Duper* size. Each bit you include gives you 1 character to print, so be sure to include enough bits or your message might get cut off!

### Beeps!

-   Each beep is unique to your username!
-   Grab a ticket (channel reward) when joining the stream to hear your beep.
-   There are other opportunities to beep, but you'll have to find that out yourself!
