# Controlling Music
By default, most of our macropad are pre-configured to control music on your computer. 

Setup buttons to play/pause music, skip to the next song and to go back to the previous song.

## Spotify
If you use Spotify, you can use these shortcuts to control the entire application. You can also use [beatBind](https://github.com/justinknguyen/BeatBind) which allows global spotify shortcuts.
