# AHK or AutoHotKey
AHK is cool and useful.

## Installing and Using AutoHotKey

Lots of these extra tips and tricks use the program [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (AHK for short) which is a free program that makes manipulating windows a lot easier.

Go to [the Autohotkey Website](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download and install the current version.

Autohotkey (AHK) relies on what they call scripts. To create a new AHK script, right click in your file explorer and select "new" and then "AutoHotKey Script".

This will create a text file with an extension (.ahk) which you can edit by right clicking and selecting "open with" and then selecting "notepad" or a different text editor.

To run the script, just double click on it. An icon should appear in the icon try. Right clicking on that will give you the option to stop the script, reload it and other options.
