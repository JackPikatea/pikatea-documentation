# The Richard Macropad User Guide

Congrats on receiving your phallic shaped macropad. This guide will walk your though how to use it. [You can find the assembly guide here if you've purchased a kit.]()

## Bumpons

We've intentially left the bumpons or keyboard "feet" off the device so that you can decide if you'd like to use them or not. We typically place one near the tip and one near the base. 

## Programming and Usage
#### Vial
Vial compatible firmware is already loaded onto your macropad. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version.

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the official Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**

## Example Uses
<Uses/>

## QMK and VIA Programming
The Pikatea Macropad is compatible with QMK and VIAL firmware.

[Pikatea QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/qmk_firmware) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by QMK and/or VIA

[Pikatea VIAL-QMK Fork](https://github.com/JackPikatea/vial-qmk) - Use this fork to create your own firmware powered by Vial

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure the USB cable is plugged in all the way. (Just because you see the LEDs going doesn't mean the data pins are connected)
* Try a different USB C cable or port
* Make sure you have the latest version of Vial installed. (the web version has issues sometimes) If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
* reflash the firmware

Sometimes the device doesn't work as expected. If this is the case, we can do a replacement/repair up to 3 months after receiving your device.
