## FinnGus Keyboard Kit User Guide
Congratulations on assembling your FinnGus Keyboard! This quick guide will walk you through how to use it.

## Programming and Usage

#### VIAL
If you've followed the assembly guide correctly, Vial firmware should be loaded onto your FinnGus. Vial is an open source program that makes it easy to configure the device with a simple interface. To get started, download Vial from the [official website here](https://get.Vial.today). Download and install the latest version (Currently Beta 0.5.2).

After Vial is installed, open the program.

Make sure your device is connected, and click "refresh". The program will automatically detect all Vial compatible devices connected. If you have multiple devices, you can cycle them with the drop down at the top. Make sure the device you want is selected and the layout matches.

**More information on VIAL can be found on [the offical Vial usage guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/)**

## Troubleshooting
Vial isn't detecting the device!
* Make sure you have the correct version of Vial installed for the firmware (in this case it's 0.4.2 beta). If you are on linux, [make sure to follow the udev portion of the install](https://get.Vial.today)
* reflash the firmware
