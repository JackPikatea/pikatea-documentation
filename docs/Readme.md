<!-- # Basic Usage

Most of our devices are used the same way and use the same software. Unless the keyboard is listed to the left, you can follow the [Basic Usage Guide]() to learn how to use and configure your device!

# Universal Assembly Guide

Most of our keyboards are built the same way. If the keyboard isn't listed below, you can follow the Universal Guide

# Examples
We've got a large list of examples on how you can setup and use your macropad or device. We love hearing how our customers use their devices and if it's something new we create an example! -->
